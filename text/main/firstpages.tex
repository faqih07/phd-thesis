\chapterNonumber{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my sincere thanks and warmest gratitude to all those who encouraged and supported me throughout my Ph.D. study (accidental omissions in the following list do not mean disacknowledgements).

\begin{itemize}

\item
% supervisor
First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude and thanks to my supervisor Milan Jirásek
for his support, encouragement and patience during the whole study,
for his personal and collegial attitude,
the freedom that I have obtained in research directions
and for being greatly inspiring both professionally and personally.
It was a pleasure to cooperate with him.
I would also like to thank him for his course Modeling of Localized Inelastic Deformation that I attended at the beginning of my Ph.D. studies and for organising annual bowling MK events.

\item
% other department members
Grateful thanks go to other department members Bořek Patzák and Vít Šmilauer for valuable discussions and for the help with \OOFEM.
I am especially grateful to Jan Zeman, who determined the direction of my next study,
for inspiration and for the honor to cooperate with him from my second university year until the Bachelor's thesis.

\item
% department friends

Last but definitely not least, I am deeply indebted to all my family.
I am grateful to my parents for their huge support and encouragement during (not only) the years of my study and for all of the sacrifices that they have made for me.
I would like to thank my brother for countless discussions on various topics and his support during the thesis finalization.

The very last but the warmest and most sincere thank belongs to my wife Katka and sons Péťa and Adámek.
Words cannot express how grateful I am for their continuous huge love, support, encouragement, inspiration, for what they all taught me and for the final motivation to complete the thesis.
Their patience with me during the finalization period, when my presence at home was rather occasional, is truly admirable.
